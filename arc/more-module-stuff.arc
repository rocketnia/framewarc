; more-module-stuff.arc
;
; This is a collection of utilities for use with the Framewarc module
; system loaded by loadfirst.arc.
;
; These were originally part of the module system proper, but it
; turned out that they weren't especially necessary. Rather than
; remaining in the module system core where they would pollute the
; global namespace, they're here in an independent module.
;
; If you especially like these utilities, you can place them in the
; global namespace yourself by running this command:
;
;   (activate `(rel ,(+ fwarc-dir* "more-module-stuff.arc")))
;
; Actually, 'activate itself could be placed in this module too, but
; if it were here, it would be slightly more difficult to accomplish
; the same effect as the above command, so it's staying as part of the
; core.
